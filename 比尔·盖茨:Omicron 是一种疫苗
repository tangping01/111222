Bill Gates: "Sadly the virus itself - particularly the variant called Omicron - is a type of vaccine, creates both B cell and T cell immunity and it's done a better job of getting out to the world population than we have with vaccines."
比尔·盖茨：“可悲的是，病毒本身——尤其是称为 Omicron 的变种——是一种疫苗，可以产生 B 细胞和 T 细胞免疫，它在向世界人口传播方面做得比我们用疫苗做得更好。”
